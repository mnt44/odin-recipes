    <h1>The <strong>REAL</strong> Long Island Iced Tea</h1>

    <h2>
        <p>The Long Island iced tea is the liquor-cabinet equivalent of what the kids once called a "suicide soda" (a big ol' splash of every drink from the soda fountain into one enormous ice-filled cup). On the face of it, the Long Island Iced tea doesn't seem tenable: Vodka, rum, gin, tequila, triple sec â€” all mingling in the same cocktail glass, tempered only by a dash of sweet and sour mix and a splash of cola. Sounds like trouble. And obviously it can be.</p>
        <p>But it's undisputable, this cocktail proves itself an unlikely success, and a prime example of when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Tossing all of these strong spirits together somehow softens the edges off of each individual spirit. It's a marvel of science, frankly. Somehow this cocktail, seemingly of odds and ends from the liquor cabinet, manages the impossible: it actually tastes good. Very good. So be careful out there, folks.</p>
